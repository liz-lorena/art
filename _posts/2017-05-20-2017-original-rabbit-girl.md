excerpt: "This drawing was based on the cover of the vaporwave album New Visuals by Bl00dwave, and it became the basis for my first personal character as an adult. Four important themes come to mind when I see this artwork: love, loneliness, and disillusionment in the virtual world. Listen to the album here: https://bl00dwave.bandcamp.com/album/--3"
