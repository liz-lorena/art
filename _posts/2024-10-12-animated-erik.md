excerpt: "On September 14, 2024, I became obsessed with <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>. After watching the 2004 and 1989 films, I watched the 1987/1988 animated version, and I succumbed to Erik's charm. Aiden Grennell was my favorite Erik. This one and 1925 are the most accurate to the book, so I had to check those out, too... <a href='/art/animated-erik-sketch'>Here is the sketch</a>. I referenced <a href='https://the-phantom-of-the-opera.fandom.com/wiki/Erik_(Animated)?file=Vlcsnap-00169.png' target='_blank'>one of my favorite frames</a>. Fun fact: I kinda broke his fingers when I inked him, that's why it's cropped this way. Really unfortunate because his hands are my favorite part of this design. Maybe I'll redo it digitally."
