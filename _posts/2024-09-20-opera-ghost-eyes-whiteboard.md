excerpt: "I watched the 1988 animated <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> fully expecting it to be completely terrible, but when I saw <a href='/img/1988-animated-eriks-eyes.jpg' target='_blank'>those eyes</a> it was over for me. I am a sucker for pretty eyes. I had to draw them on my whiteboard. The initials are from the 1925 silent film. Yes, my coworkers know I'm insane."
