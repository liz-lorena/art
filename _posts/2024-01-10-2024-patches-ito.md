excerpt: "I'm back with another psychopath! This time it's my favorite dog Patches Ito from the visual novel series Purrfect Apawcalypse. The drawing is pencil on my new sketchbook and colored digitally on FireAlpaca because the game has a similarish style. I played it over New Year's break because I got the trilogy cheap on Steam. I didn't think I'd like this guy, but he's basically a stereotypical edgelord stalker INTJ, and how could I not love that? You know I'm a simpering fool for those sorts of characters. I think it triggers that I CAN FIX THEM instinct. I drew most of this while listening to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nGo_QZKbOA' target='_blank'>Monuments by Smashing Pumpkins</a>. I find the line 'Lover, you're strange' to be particularly fitting. I don't want to spoil the story too much, though. <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/23074/Purrfect_Apawcalypse_The_Clawmplete_Series/' target='_blank'>Check it out!</a>"
