excerpt: "I'm back with another psychopath! This time it's my favorite dog Patches Ito from the visual novel series Purrfect Apawcalypse. I played it over New Year's break because I got the trilogy cheap on Steam. I didn't think I'd like this guy, but he's basically a stereotypical edgelord stalker INTJ, and how could I not love that?"
