excerpt: "On September 14, 2024, I became obsessed with <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>. A few days after watching the 2004 movie I listened to <a href='https://youtu.be/_y8egEs96A0?si=wE8tpKREkufk9lGk' target='_blank'>Tony Walker's reading</a> of the 1911 De Mattos translation of the novel by Gaston Leroux. After that, I really wanted to try drawing the Erik from the book. I gave him a red cape instead of a black cape because I didn't want to overuse the black, and I think he likes red. The red cape and the clawed hands are from the 1988 cartoon, and the red signature is from the 1925 silent film. I actually used <a href='https://www.deviantart.com/sylent-fantome/art/Leroux-Erik-makeup-for-Radio-Drama-art-356124553' target='_blank'>this awesome cosplay by Sylent-Fantome</a> as a reference for his face. If it wasn't already obvious, I'm hopelessly in love with Erik. <a href='/art/leroux-erik'>Here is the colored version</a>."
