excerpt: "I wanted to draw the Erik from <a href='https://phantomoftheopera.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera?file=Cover.jpg' target='_blank'>the original cover painted by Andr√© Castaigne</a> on <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> by Gaston Leroux with some changes, mainly his hat and his mask, to match the text a little closer. I prefer a smiling Erik over the more melancholy depictions. I referenced my own hand. Unfortunately, the hat I drew originally was more accurate before I turned it into a fedora. It turns out that fedoras weren't invented until 1890, a few years after the events in the book. So, his hat actually probably looked more like <a href='https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1989_film)?file=Phantom89.jpg' target='_blank'>Robert Englund's Phantom</a> in the 1989 movie or the hat in <a href='https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/mx/jg/tz/ni/v-for-vendetta-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000.jpg' target='_blank'>V for Vendetta</a>."
