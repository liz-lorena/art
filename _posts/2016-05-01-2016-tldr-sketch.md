excerpt: "This is a pen sketch of the mascot of a YouTube channel I used to watch in 2016. His mascot is a teal deer, which is a play on the acronym TL;DR, meaning Too Long, Didn't Read, because his channel was focused on reading and analyzing news and research articles that were used incorrectly as sources."
